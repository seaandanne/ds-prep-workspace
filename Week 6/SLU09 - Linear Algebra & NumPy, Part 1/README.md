# SLU09 - Linear Algebra & NumPy, Part 1

In this unit you'll be introduced to Linear Algebra, a key subject for data scientists. You'll learn how you can handle matrices and vectors, their main properties and basic operations, the intuitions behind the "linear" in Linear Algebra, and how to apply basic matrix operations using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (v1.18), the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. You'll learn how to create numpy arrays, understand their shape and dimension, how to subset rows and columns in matrices (2D arrays), use boolean indexing and perform concatenation.

# New concepts in this unit
- Vectors: linear combinations, basic operations, the transpose and the dot product, linear independence;
- Matrices: special matrices, basic operations and the transpose;
- NumPy library and ndarrays: the numpy array, basics of vector and matrix operations in NumPy, ndarrays shape and dimension, indexing and concatenation.
